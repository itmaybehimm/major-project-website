            <p>
              In the digital age, networks and information systems have become integral to the functioning of various
              sectors including finance, healthcare, education, and national security. The reliance on these
              interconnected systems has made them attractive targets for cyber threats, ranging from malware and
              ransomware to sophisticated hacking and advanced persistent threats. To mitigate these risks, Intrusion
              Detection Systems (IDS) are essential security mechanisms that monitor network traffic and
              system activities for signs of malicious behavior. Traditional IDS techniques, such as signature-based and
              anomaly-based detection, have limitations. Signature-based IDS rely on known attack patterns to identify
              threats, making them ineffective against new and unknown attacks. Anomaly-based IDS, while capable of
              detecting novel threats by identifying deviations from normal behavior, often suffers from high false
              positive rates, leading to alert fatigue and decreased trust in the system. With the advent of Artificial
              Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), there is significant potential to enhance the capabilities of
              IDS. AI-based IDS can learn from vast amounts of data, adapt to new and evolving threats, and improve
              detection accuracy while reducing false positives. These systems can analyze complex patterns and
              correlations in network traffic beyond human capabilities, providing a more robust and adaptive
              defense mechanism against cyber threats.
